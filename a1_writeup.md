# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?

I'm having some of trouble with the syntax, but I do appreciate how the language makes it easier to program. I like that you don't have to use semi colons, and that indentation is what's most important. The importance of indentatio also makes it easier too read. I think when yuo open and close functions with curly braces it can be pretty hard to read, because indentation doesn't need to be uniform.



2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?
syntactically, i think that pythin is very differnt than java. instead of writing system.out.println, you just write print, or the way you write for loops is very different. thiscan be very challenging for me to remember, because I've used java and javascript in the past. honestly, not many similarities come to md for me between python and other programming languages I've used.



3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?
I learned a lot about pythin syntax. even though i'm still struggling a little bit, i kow so much more than i did before, and i really like learning it. i don't think i prefer i to java, but it's fun for me to learn new languages
